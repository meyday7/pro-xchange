After the long break, we are back with a new post! As it is written in the title, this post will discuss all administrative affairs related to finalizing the registration processes at KU Leuven. Firstly, it is important to mention that there are two types of exchanges between KEDGE BS and KU Leuven students, so information for both types of exchanges will be provided. However, for anyone else (not KEDGE students), the classic exchanges information should be applied for the exchange between your home university and KUL.

Disclaimer: The information below will discuss the admission requirements, meaning that once you are enrolled, there might be additional steps needed to receive the diploma at the end of the bachelor. However, the information on any additional steps should be provided during the first weeks of studies. Moreover, some steps in the registration process are different than before because of the pandemic. For the sake of this post, the guide below should provide relevant information on the day of the writing of this post.

## Overview

In this post, readers will find:

- Discussion of key steps and documents required
- Deadlines
- Registration in the town hall

So without further ado, let's dive into the topic!

## Double-degree programme at KU Leuven

At KEDGE, there are only language requirements for the double degree programme. KEDGE students need at least: TOEFL IBT with **90** points or IELTS **6.5** with 5.5 minimum for all sections. For students, who followed IBBA courses in full English during year 1 and 2, only **79** points are needed on TOEFL IBT.

KEDGE students, who wish to follow the courses at KU Leuven for the double degree programme, will go through the registration that is similar for all international students on the KU Leuven side. Remember this date: **1st of June** is the deadline for the application for the double degree programme for European Economic Area (EEA) citizens! This means that if you are registered as a citizen in France, this is the deadline to follow. For students, who have citizenship outside of EEA (check this [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Area) for more information on members of EEA), the deadline is **1 March**. However, in both cases, it is advised to apply as soon as possible before these dates.

The first requirement at the Belgian uni is to provide the diploma of secondary education. Given that most students received their secondary education in France, the french secondary education diploma will be sufficient. It is important to provide the school with both the original document, as well as the official **translated** version in English (translated by certified translator).

It might be required, upon arrival in Belgium, to go through _a diploma check_. This is a process done by the registrar's office in Leuven, to make sure the legitimate diploma is provided to the school. Currently, there are two ways it can be done: electronically or in person. For electronic processing, you need to provide proof of graduation through a secured digital document. Citing the information on the website of KU Leuven, it is possible through:

- A secured PDF of your degree/graduation statement/transcript with electronic signature,
- A degree/graduation statement/transcript with a working QR code,
- A verification website of your previous educational institution where we can verify your degree (in this case make sure to send us the password or verification code we will need for the verification),
- An official confirmation of your graduation sent to us via email by the responsible staff of your previous educational institution

However, assuming that your secondary education institution does not provide digital documents eligible for an electronic diploma check, you will be required to visit the city of Leuven (the address: Naamsestraat 22, Leuven, Belgium for the office verifying your documents).

For other documents, make sure to provide the school with a photocopy of the **identity page of your passport**, **motivation letter** and **CV**. For the double degree programme, it is worth noting that you will be registered for additional math courses. Finally, there is no need to pay an application fee. You will receive an email from the school official. That email will be proof that you don't need to pay.

If you have managed to prepare all the documents mentioned above, you can move to [this](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/application/instructions) website. You can revisit the information about the application there. However, the most important is the web app for registration. Since there is no 'BBA double degree' available in the software, you have to choose a standard bachelor of business administration as the programme you will follow. University staff should take care of that and they should register you for the courses you have to follow as part of the double degree programme.

Once you upload all the files, the application is complete and will be processed within 4 to 8 weeks. You can check the progress of the application screening on the web app used for submitting the application. For that reason, the university advises keeping your logins and passwords until you receive the letter of acceptance. The remainder of the registration, including diploma check, will be done in Belgium and more detailed guidance on practicalities will be provided before your arrival.

## Classic exchange

The deadlines for 1st semester of 1 year of the exchange is the **1st of May**. For applications in the second semester, the deadline is the **1st of October**.

For classic exchange (one semester or one year long), the steps are slightly simpler. Once you were nominated for the exchange, you will receive an email with the application procedure. You will also receive an online application form. For that form, students need to provide documents listed below:

- ID photo
- Copy of identity card or passport
- Transcript of Records of all grades from previous semester/years (to show how many ECTS/credits you have achieved up until now)
- Proof of proficiency in english
- Learning agreement

Regarding the transcript of records, it is important to provide KU Leuven with officially **signed** and **stamped** documents confirming the authenticity.

For proof of proficiency in English, there are few options available. Firstly, students can request a document from KEDGE stating that the student is registered for an English-taught course (in case that is the situation of course :D). Secondly, students can ask the university to provide a certificate confirming that the student possesses a sufficient level of English. One of those two methods normally should work and are recommended. However, if for some reasons it is not possible, a student can also take an examination like TOEFL, IELTS or Cambridge Assessment confirming that he or she possesses level B1. Lastly, the learning agreement is a document necessary for the erasmus programme. KU Leuven officials will provide you with the document and will guide you on how to fill it in.

As with a double degree programme, classic exchanges can take from 4 to 8 weeks to be processed. The progress of application acceptance can be followed on the website through which the application was made, so again, make sure to keep the logins and passwords! The final preparation done in person will be communicated to you personally before the beginning of the school year/semester.

## Registration in the town hall

_This section is only relevant for double degree students, so if you do not plan on doing double degree, you can move directly to 'final words' section of this post!_

In Belgium, students, who plan on studying for more than one year need to apply for a residence permit card. It is an electronic card with your personal information used by the institutions in Belgium. It stores different types of information like address, medical records etc.

In the first article on housing (you can find it right [here!](https://pro-xchange.me/belgium/2021/03/24/belgium-housing.html)), we have discussed the division of Brussels into districts, or _communes_. To receive this residence permit card, you will need to go to a city hall in your commune. There, the process of registration will start. While registering, the city officials will also _domiciliate_ you in Belgium. In the same post mentioned above, we discuss what domiciliation is. Generally, you need to provide the address where you want to be officially registered. As a part of the verification of your domiciliation, police will try to schedule a meeting with you in your apartment. Once it's done, your residence permit should be ready to pick up from the commune.

A word of caution: some communes might apply slightly different rules. In that case, it is best to consult the exact procedure at the time of applying for a residence permit. Some communes have representatives on-site, who speak English and will guide you through the different steps.

The officials in the commune hall will usually speak only in french and dutch, so for KEDGE students, it should not be a problem. However, in the communes, which are a part of Flanders, the office representative might not speak french. It might make the process a bit slower, but eventually, you will get there (just as I did when I arrived in Belgium)!
