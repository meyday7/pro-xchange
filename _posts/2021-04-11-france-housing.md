After our first post on housing in Belgium, it is time to give you more information about housing in Marseille. While on the exchange, you will spend a lot of time at university, in the city and at home. A comfortable and welcoming home is a key element that will impact your exchange experience. Therefore, looking for accommodation that fits you and your requirements is more important than you think. In this post I will discuss the following aspects:

- **Search for accommodation**
- **Best areas to live in**
- **Transportation**
- **Administration**
  - **Insurance**
  - **Domiciliation**
  - **Contract and deposit**
  - **CAF**

## Search for accommodation
When you start the search for your accommodation it is really important to start early. You should start looking for accommodation somewhere between 3 to 6 months before your departure. This is because you will have a broader spectrum of choice if you do it early on, while if you take a last moment decision, you might end up taking an accommodation you don’t like at all.

Secondly, the best tool that will help you find the accommodation you need is [Studapart](https://www.studapart.com/en). Besides other websites, Studapart is a partner of KEDGE BS and it is a website that is specially designed for [KEDGE (international) students](https://kedge.studapart.com/en). When logging in you should use the login information provided to you by KEDGE.  The website has an easy interface, and it is also in English. On the website, you can choose in which area you would like to live and what kind of accommodation you want, and you can easily get in contact with landlords.
Besides, if you ever have any question regarding housing in France contact Studapart with any question you have. They have a multilingual team, and they can offer you any information you might need.
Studapart is the easiest tool to use for international students as French landlords require you to have a French guarantor. This is a person that receives its incomes in France and will be able to financially cover for you (for example in case you won’t pay your rent). As many international students do not have a French guarantor, Studapart allows you to buy a certificate by which Studapart can be your guarantor. The price of this certificate will depend on the duration of your stay at one apartment and the price of rent. Besides, the certificate will also certify your account and make your profile more appealing to landlords when looking for accommodation. This can be an advantage as finding accommodation that meets your requirements can end up in tight competition with other tenants. Be aware, not all landlords accept a Studapart guarantee, so check this requirement for each accommodation that interests you.

Another known option is the student residence of Alotra which is 5 minutes away from the campus. If you want more information about the residence you can find it [here](https://student.kedge.edu/student-services/prepare-my-studies-abroad/accommodation/accommodation-marseille) and [here](https://www.alotra.fr/logement-student-halls-residence-9-en.html). The residence has mostly shared kitchens and showers and the living conditions are of a lower standard.  

In France you will often see the notation of T# with # being 1, 2, 3 … This notation refers to the number of rooms the accommodation has (bathroom and kitchen not included). So, for a one-room accommodation, you will have the notation T1 while for a small apartment of one bedroom, living room with kitchen and bathroom you will have notation T2.

## Best areas to live in
While on the internet you might read a lot about Marseille being a dangerous city, I think this statement is an exaggeration. I also had my concerns when moving to Marseille, but that changed.

Below you can find the map of Marseille with all districts numbered.

Further on, when looking for accommodation you might want to know in which areas it is best to live in.  Marseille is divided into different ‘_arrondissements_’. The most popular area for students is the 6th arrondissement. Many students look for accommodation near Castellane, Périer or Prado. This is because it is easy and fast to have a direct connection to KEDGE Campus Luminy, which is in the 9th arrondissement.

Other good areas are the 1st and 5th arrondissements. This is because you will have close access to a huge variety of shops, supermarkets and popular cultural attractions.

The 2nd and 3rd arrondissements are a bit further away so it might take more time to reach the campus. Also, while these areas are good to live in, you might want to be more careful during the night.

While the 7th and 8th arrondissements are also great areas to live in, it might be harder to find a good transport connection to the campus.

The 14th, 15th and 16th arrondissements are the poorest areas in Marseille, and it is mostly here that dangerous and illegal activities happen.

Every other arrondissement not discussed above means that it is too far to reach the campus, or it has a bad transport connection to the campus.

Lastly, you also can find accommodation in the 9th arrondissement, however, if you really want to have a true student experience, I suggest you find accommodation more closely to the centre of the city.

The most important advice I can give you is to keep an eye on your belongings at all times, as just like in any other major city pickpocketers are always present.  Besides, do not walk alone at night as the chance of being robbed can increase.

## Transportation
If you want to move around Marseille, then you can do so by bus, tram, metro and shared bikes.  If you want to go and visit other cities nearby then you can always take the train at Marseille-Saint-Charles train station which is in the 1St arrondissement.
The public transport provider in Marseille is [RTM](https://www.rtm.fr). And because the campus is located in the National Parc, without your own means of transportation, you will undoubtedly need a transport subscription from RTM. There are monthly and yearly subscriptions for students that you can find [here](https://www.rtm.fr/tarifs). With one subscription you will be able to access the bus, tram, metro, some boat connection and short train connections. Also for an additional 1 euro (with students’ subscription) or 5 euros a year you can use the shared city bikes [Le vélo](http://en.levelo-mpm.fr). For more information about the deal, check [this link](https://www.rtm.fr/levelo).
The most popular bus lines to get to the campus and back home are the 21JET, 24 and B1. You might also need to use the tram lines (T1, T2 or T3) and the metro lines (M1 or M2) if you live further away.

## Administration
### Insurance
Unlike in Belgium, landlords are not required to insure their properties. Therefore, when finding accommodation, the landlord might require you to ensure the accommodation for the entire duration of your stay before moving in. If you booked accommodation through Studapart, then they will also give you the choice to book insurance through them and their partner. However, this insurance is slightly more expensive than other choices provided by other insurances agencies. [ADH](https://www.assurances-etudiants.com) and [MAE](https://www.mae.fr/contrats/assurance-habitation-etudiant) provide insurances especially for students and they can give you more protection at a lower price than Studapart. Through these agencies you can easily buy your insurance 100% online, so your accommodation can be covered before you move in.  If these agencies are not giving you the full coverage that you need or want, then you can always look for other companies on the web and see which one meets your requirements. Most insurance agencies give you the possibility to simulate the price of your insurance based on the surface of your accommodation, the number of people that live in the same accommodation and the kind of coverage you want (standard or full).

These insurances apply to private properties. For student residences, they might not apply so I suggest you contact your student residence and ask if you need such insurance.

### Domiciliation
Unlike in Belgium, in France, you do not need to domiciliate. This is because in France you don’t need a residence permit and a permanent address.

### Contract and deposit
Just like in Belgium, before moving in you will have to pay a deposit. This amount depends on the requirement of your landlord. If you will be using Studapart, then this amount will be shown to you. Besides the deposit, with Studapart you might also have to pay a booking fee, but this depends on the accommodation.

Moreover, when moving in, you will have to sign the contract with your landlord. Besides signing the contract, you will also have to verify the inventory together with your landlord. This means that you will note down the state of the apartment and the utilities there. This is to ensure that the utilities and the state of the apartment will not change during your stay and that when moving out, you can receive back your deposit in full amount. In France, you have to inform your landlord that you will leave the accommodation 1 to 2 months before your departure. The landlord has 3 months the time to give you back your deposit.

### CAF
The last thing to discuss in this post is CAF. [CAF](https://www.caf.fr)  is a social agency created by the French government to help people, families and students with social or financial aids. This financial aid applies to international students. However, this aid can be received only on the accommodation. Depending on your accommodation and your or your parent's income, you might or might not be eligible for CAF.
If you want to be eligible for CAF, before booking a place to stay, you should ask the landlord if the accommodation is eligible for state aids. On Studapart this information is given directly most of the time in the offer description. If the accommodation of your choice is eligible for state aids, then on the website of CAF you can run a simulation and see what your financial aid might amount to. After opening a bank account and signing the rental contract, you should start the application for APL on the CAF website. APL is a personal social aid for accommodations. This is the only relevant aid for (international) students regarding their accommodation. The process of acceptance of your application can take even up to three months. From time to time, I would suggest you contact CAF and ask if they have every document they need. This is because even though you might have sent them everything they asked for, they might still ask you for the same documents again.
