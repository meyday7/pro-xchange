## Brussels

Kicking off with a city where you will spent most of your time in! It has a rich cultural legacy and there is plenty of things to check.

### The Grand Place

The should be the first site you will visit in Brussels. The square in the heart of the old town is a place of different festivities and generally a good meeting point. During different seasons, you can find there the floral display, christmas tree and animations, horse riding display done by Brussels police and light show! There is also plenty of restaurants and shops nearby.
