One of the most important aspects of going on exchange is finding a good accomodation. While you will spend lots of time outside, it is something that you will be coming back to and where you will be living. That is why the first informational post will be all about finding a good **accomodation in Belgium**. In this post we will discuss:

- **Websites:** where to look for a new home
- **Contract and Deposit:** and how does it work?
- **Types of Accomodation:** do you want to live in students' residence or somewhere private?
- **Mapping out Brussels** so you know where to live (or not!)
- **Domiciliation:** and what it is exactly?
- **Transportation:** and why it's a steal!

## Websites

The first point is related to checking out the accomodation you might live in. And I mean in person. While I didn't consider it during my exchange, it might be a good idea to firstly rent an accomodation (like an Airbnb) for a _short-term_ while looking for a long-term accomodation in person. If you are staying for a longer period of time in Brussels it is wise to investigate thoroughly the accomodation you might to live in. This way you have possibility of visiting the accomodation before moving in and to see if it meets your expectations. However, there are a few drawbacks with that:

1. The longer you take to find your final accomodation, the harder it becomes to find a good deal
2. It is an additional effort to move your belongings twice
3. It might be more expensive

However, I can assure you that it is not very hard to find a nice appartement without visiting it in person.

Now to the main point, when looking for an appartment online, you can use private websites (there are plenty of those) or you can use KU Leuven's renting website (only works for Leuven - another city that is 25 minutes away with train).

[The website of KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/life-at-ku-leuven/housing/find-housing/students/student-housing-leuven) offers relatively cheap housing in the city of **Leuven** (starting from 240 euros) - where the main campus of KU Leuven is. However, for your exchange you will be studying in Brussels. That implies travelling between Leuven and Brussels. The price  of the train subscription depends the specific connection (meaning that when you will make the subscription, you will be asked to give your connection - in this case _Leuven_ - _Brussels_ ). For more information about the prices of the student subscription, take a look at the website of the [Belgian train company](https://www.belgiantrain.be/en).

_Remark:_ Belgium is a very small country, meaning that you can live in any city (like Antwerp, Bruges, Ghent) and have a direct connection with the train to Brussels.

However, if you prefer to live in **Brussels** (which I did), then you are left with looking for different accomodation offers online. In order to find different possible websites, all it takes is checking google for _student accomodation in Brussels_. However, I will provide few websites of interest below.

- [KU Leuven's recommended website - Brik](https://brik.mykot.be/en/rooms?distance=3&min=200&max=600&room_type=K&period=academic_year&submit=Search&advanced=Advanced%20search)
- [Erasmusu](https://erasmusu.com) was the first website I used for finding accomodations in Brussels. The interface is very simple and clear. They provide a checklist with different amenities and a map to see where you would be living.
- [Housing Anywhere](https://housinganywhere.com/s/Brussels--Belgium/student-accommodation)
- [Spotahome](https://www.spotahome.com/for-rent/brussels/student-apartments)

The only difference between them is their interface and pricing. Those companies work as intermediaries between renters and students, so they charge a fee when you finalize the rent through their website. Make sure to check it!

When it comes to prices in Brussels, you can find good accomodations starting from around 350 euros for a single room. Very often either kitchen or bathroom will be shared with other students/people living in the building, so depending on your needs, make sure to check what is the case for each offer online. Logically, the more you pay, the more you get. That means the higher the rent, the more _luxuries_ you get (washing machine, dishwasher etc.)

## Contract and Deposit

In Belgium, contracts include paying a **deposit**. This is an assurance for the renter in case you will destroy something in the appartment that will require repairing. However, most of the time you will not do that and so it will be returned to you after you leave your accomodation. The one thing to watch for is that some renters (the bad ones) can take up to three months to return the money (it is unfortunately legal in Brussels).

The value of the deposit will often be equal to the **double** amount of monthly rent (speaking from personal experience). However, in 2019 the government of Brussels (yes, this is different from Belgian federal government) allowed renters to increase the deposit to **triple** of the monthly rent, so don't be surprised if that happens to you.

Depending on the way your renter made a contract, the monthly rent will differ. Either additional costs, like water, electricity, internet, will be included in rent or not. Very often you will find the value of additional costs on the websites mentioned above. They differ for every listing. Make sure that the price of monthly rent includes (or not) the additional costs, as those can mount up to 80 euros (game changer for me!).

Lastly, the contract that you will sign with the landlord needs to explicitly mention that it is a _students' contract_. It is important for the commune where you will be registering yourself and it comes with slightly different set of rules. Nevertheless, the landlord usually makes sure himself that you sign a students' contract.

## Types of accomodation

While looking for an appartment, you might want to live with other people in duplex or alone, in a studio, kot (belgian name for single room) or student residence. All of them offer different amenities and come at different prices.

I will start off with a kot. Those offer the smallest space, usually with a bed, a desk and a bathroom. Kitchen is usually shared among all the students or people living on the same floor or in the same section of the building. You can find those in private renting or in student residences. They are the cheapest option available!

Next, you can find a studio. A studio is a well-equipped room with bedroom, kitchen and bathroom. It comes at higher price (usually above 400-450 euros), but at the same time it is bigger. You can find some students living in bigger studios together.

Duplex is another name for co-renting the appartment with other students. On the aforementioned websites you can often find offers from students who are looking for another roommate. There are often few specifications to that, but the prices are also very convincing and spaces are usually bigger.

Now, you can find kot, studio and duplex from a private landlord **OR** you can look for student residences. In Brussels there are two most popular student houses chosen by students from KU Leuven: _Brusello_ and _Studeopolis_. Both are renovated, well-equipped and have some common room for playing pool or watching something on the projector. If you are looking for a proximity of other students, make sure to look there. But beware, sometimes the prices are slightly higher than what private landlords can offer.

## Domiciliation

If you have been already looking for accomodation in Brussels, you might have meet a term **domiciliation**. This term is mostly used when registering with your district commune (More about communes in the post on Administration). It basically means that this address will be used as the main address in Belgium. It is very important for the renters (some of them receive social payments from the government depending on who is domiciliated under the address), but it is also very important for you and the school. You are required by KU Leuven to provide the address under which you are domiciliated.

That is why plenty of offers online will already mention if it is possible to get domiciliation under this address or not. If they don't mention it, feel free to ask the landlord.

## Best (or worst) districts to live in

Like almost every city on this planet, there are better and worse place to live in. Brussels is no exception and it is worth knowing where it is safe or not. Below you can find a map of Brussels with the division of different districts:

![Communes in Brussels]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/communes.jpeg)

To put it simply, Brussels is a pretty safe city. In the city center (Ville de Bruxelles) there is a higher activity of pickpocketers, so watch out for your belongings when you go for city stroll. The districts with highest crime rate are: **Moleenbeek**, **Schaerbeek** and **Anderlecht**. In Brussels-City you may want to avoid places around **Bruxelles-Nord** (Brussels North station) and **Bruxelles-Midi** (Brussels South station).

While living there is possible, you might want to be more attentive of your surroundings. These places are known in the media for the criminality, violence and other illegal acitivites like drugs. Definitely do not walk there alone at night! 

Otherwise, anything else works perfectly fine. There are few beatiful areas like Ixelles, Saint-Josse, European District or Uccle. From my experience, I can also suggest smaller cities nearby Brussels like Saint-Peeters-Leeuw, Dilbeek or Zaventem. Those are way greener and calmer, but way further from the city and school, so this is up to you!

## Transportation

If you will be using the public transportation in Brussels (and most definitely you will), then you are in for the the treat! Brussels offers one of the cheapest transportation subscriptions for students in western Europe! For around 50 euros a year, you will have access to all buses, trams and metros in city of Bruxelles. All you need for that is the attestation that will be given to you at your arrival, student ID and your photo.

While talking about transportation, it is important to mention that in Belgium transportation gets as complicated as it can get. The administrative division of Belgium led to very a unusal transport system. In Brussels, the company that takes care of all the transportation is called **STIB-MIVB**. They offer buses, trams and metros for the 50 euros subscription. At the same time, in Flanders (north of Brussels), we have another operator called **De Lijn**. They have their own system of buses and trams. Finally, in Wallonia, the operator is called **TEC**. Therefore it is important to know in which region you will live in (Flanders, Brussels region or Wallonia). For instance, if you live outside the Brussels region, in Flanders, and you will use public transportation to the university, then you will need two subscriptions (one for Flanders and one for Brussels).

## Closing words and other informations

Since I couldn't categorize the following information in any of the sections above, you can find them below:

- In Belgium the **house insurance** is usually covered by the landlord. There is no need for you to do it.
- Make sure you take pictures of all the imperfections of your accomodation and mail them to the landlord. Ask him to confirm the current state of the accomodation. This way you make sure that you will receive your deposit.
- In Belgium it is legally required to inform your landlord **three months** before the end of contract that you do not wish to extend it. In case you want to extend it, usually there will be an appendix to the main contract in which you and your landlord will agree that you can stay there longer under the similar conditions.

If you have managed to go through everything in this post, then GOOD JOB! It is a lot of information, but knowledge is power, so knowing how it works in Brussels with housing will make your exchange easier and will give you a nicer experience!
