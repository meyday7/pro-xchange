## Visit Marseille

### Vieux Port
I see Vieux Port as the heart of Marseille. Here you can find plenty of bars and restaurant, different locations to walk around and a beautiful place where you can watch the sunset or sunrise.
The place is full of boats, and I think that is what makes it so special. It gives that hot and Mediterranean vibe you hoped to find.
The place is kind of a gathering point for everyone. You will see people just sitting down next to the water enjoying their lunch while enjoying a good talk with good company.

### Mucem
Mucem is a museum that is very well known in Marseille. I think even people who are not even from Marseille know Mucem. Mucem is part of the history and evolution of Marseille and the Mediterranean region in general.
The museum offers different exhibitions and events. If you want to know more then check the link here https://www.mucem.org/en .
Also, as a student, it is worth known that every first Sunday of the month the entry is free in the entire museum. On the other days, you can visit for free the exterior spaces and the gardens.

### Cathédrale La Major
The cathedral can be found not far away from Vieux Port and Mucem. If you are taking a walk, it is hard to miss it out. This is because the cathedral is quite big and has a very unique architecture. If you dare, you can also enter and take a look inside, it is quite breathtaking.

### Notre Dame De La Garde
A spot to go to when you are in Marseille. Not only because the church itself is beautiful inside and outside, but because it finds itself on a little hill. This allows you to have a 360° view over the city of Marseille. I can say that the view is magnificent as well during the day as during the night. Also, this would be the perfect spot to watch the sunset.

### If Castle and the Frioul Islands
The If Castle is very well known for its legend of Monte Cristo. The Castle can be found on a little island not far from Vieux Port. Next to the If Castle, you can also find the Frioul Islands. If you come and visit don’t forget your swimsuit as you can find some very lovely spots to bath and suntan. You can buy tickets at Vieux Port.

### Calanques
A beautiful and unique thing that Marseille has it it’s the Calanques. These are rock formations next to the Mediterranean Sea. As the water has a turquoise color, the effect together with the Calanques is breathtaking. This is definitely something worth doing. But be aware, make sure to take some good sports shoes, if you want to enjoy the calanques, it will a big walk. You can of course choose easier or more difficult tracks. You can get to the Calanques by taking the same transportation method as the one you get for the campus. You have to go to the last station, which is one additional station then the one you take for the campus.

### Palais Longchamp
Longchamp Park has a beautiful garden which is the best place for a stroll or a picnic. If you feel like it, you can also visit the two museums which find themselves in the palace. The east wing houses the Musée des Beaux-Arts and the west wing, which houses the Museum d'Histoire Naturelle

### Plage du Prophète and Plage du Prado
Also, it is impossible to come to Marseille without fully enjoying the sun and the heat. Therefore, the best way to enjoy it is to go to the beach. The colour of the Mediterranean Sea is remarkable, and it would be a shame to leave Marseille without a beautiful tan.

The biggest beaches you can go to are the Plage du Prophète and Plage du Prado. The beaches are next to one another and you can easily get there by public transport or by the city bikes.

### Parc Borely and Parc du 26ème Centenaire
If at any point you feel that you had too much water or sand, you can always go and visit these two parks. Both parks are super big, and the feeling of being in the nature gives a comforting feeling.  The 26ème Centenaire park is divided between little parc in a different theme. In Parc Borely you can find flower gardens and even a beautiful Japanese garden. The entry is free.

## Visit beyond Marseille

Once you have fully visited Marseille, you might think it is time to visit something else. Well, you are lucky. Marseille is a big city, and it has a well-developed transportation system that can bring you wherever you would like. Here I am just giving some possible destinations that are not too far away from Marseille. If you want to know more details about the places mentioned here then visit [this website here](https://www.thecrazytourist.com).

### Cassis
If you want you can visit Cassis, which is not so far away from Marseille. There you can visit the Calanques of Cassis. You can do so by foot or if you want more of an adventure then you can rent a kayak. Cassis is a small city, and you can visit it quite fast. I recommend coming here if you want to visit the Calanques or the variety of beaches.

### Aix-en-Provence
Another close destination to Marseille is Aix-en-Provence. Just like any other city, Aix-en-Provence has its typical churches and museum that you can visit. However, the city is great if you just want to go for a stroll. You can visit the old Aix (the old city centre), cours Mirabeau and the streets of Mazarin. The city has a lot of fountains that give it a very summer-like ambience. If you are also inspired by art, you can go and visit the Cézanne studio of Paul Cézanne. Here is where he worked the last years of his life and everything has been left untouched. Later, you can also check the mountains of Sainte-Victoire, which was also a point of inspiration for the artists’ paintings.

### Monaco
Monaco is definitely a place everyone knows from the F1 racing or the James Bond movies. Besides strolling around the old town and checking the luxurious yachts, there are some other interesting things that you can do. You can visit the Monte Carlo casino and the Casino square, I am sure the James Bond fans would love this. Further on you can visit quite some gardens. Jardin Exotique, Les Jardins Saint-Martin, princess grace rose garden or the Japanese gardens, are all place you can visit if you are a flower lover. If not, you can always just get a beautiful suntan at the Larvotto beach. However, if you are more into cars then you should go to Fontvielle and check out the old car collection of the prince of Monaco. Also, if you plan an entire visit then don’t forget to get your lunch, for a student the prices might seem to be very elevated.

### Nice
Nice is a very colourful city due to its colourful buildings. You will see these light colours even in the Nice Cathedral located in the old town or the Monastère de Cimiez. If you want a beautiful panorama over the city go to Parc de la Colline du Château. If you like animals and nature, then don’t miss the opportunity of visiting Parc Phoenix. The entry is very cheap and there is a lot to see.
