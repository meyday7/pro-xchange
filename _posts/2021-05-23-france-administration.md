After a while, we are ready and steady for another blog post. This week we will explain everything regarding the administration requirements KU Leuven students need to fulfil for their exchange to KEDGE BS.

Disclaimer: This post will only include information regarding the double degree programme and will not include information for a classic exchange. If you plan a classic exchange (a semester), then please click on this [link](https://feb.kuleuven.be/eng/international/going-abroad/exchanges) for more information. On the same link, at the bottom of the page, you can find the contact information of the exchange coordinators that can help you with any question you might have.

Also, if you are not a student from KU Leuven, then please contact your home university about the administration requirements for your exchange. 

Lastly, this information is relevant only at the moment of writing this post. KU Leuven and KEDGE BS can and are allowed to change their requirements at any time. Therefore, always make sure to ask if anything changed or if other requirements apply.

## Overview

- This post will cover the following topics:
- Requirements for the double degree programme
- The process 
- Other information

So now, let’s get to it!

## Requirements for the double degree programme
To apply for the double degree programme with Kedge, you need to be enrolled for the Bachelor of Business Administration at KU Leuven. This means that you will study your first two years at KU Leuven and the last two years at KEDGE. You will be registered for the double degree from the third year onwards, this meaning the first year at which you will study at KEDGE. 
You can apply between early December and early February. For the application, you will have to write a motivation letter. After that period, you will be also invited for an interview. A motivation letter and an interview are needed to make a selection of students for the programme as spaces are limited. However, over the past years, not many students have applied so this means that you have a high chance of being selected.

However, even though you have been selected, there are a few more requirements you need to fulfil to be able to go to KEDGE. The most important one is that you have to pass all your courses from the first two years. In your second year, you are allowed to have resit exams. However, by the time you will receive the scores of your resit exams, you will already start the academic year at KEGDE. This means that if you have passed your resit exams, you can continue to study at KEDGE, but if not, then you will be required to come back to KU LEUVEN and you won’t be able to follow the double degree anymore. 

Further on, before your arrival KEDGE BS also requires you to prove your proficiency in English and French. For English, you need at least a B2-level and you are allowed to take the following tests: TOEFL IBT (min 79), TOEIC (min 785), IELTS or Cambridge First (min 6.5). For French, you need at least a B1-level, and you are allowed to take the following tests: TCF, DELF or DALF. You are exempted from one of the tests if you are a native of French or English.

If you do have already done these tests in the past and you have acquired the required minimum, then you do not need to take the tests again. However, if you have never done these tests then you are not required to take them for your entry at KEDGE. Once you have received your login and password from KEDGE, you will be able to download the KEDGE certificates. These certificates concern your academic level and your proficiency in English. These certificates can be filled in by you and then signed by your exchange coordinator. 

However, these certificates are only valid for your entry at KEDGE. To meet the degree requirements and to receive your diploma from KEDGE, you will have to take one of the official English tests mentioned above. For the French test, you can take an internal test at KEDGE that is free of charge, or you can take one of the official French tests mentioned above.  As you can see, you can do the tests early on before your entry at KEDGE, if not you will have to take them later on to get your degree.

If you did manage to fulfil the requirements mentioned above, then once you arrive at KEDGE, you also have to register and pay €90 for CVEC (Student and Campus Life Contribution).

Lastly, besides the language requirements, to receive your degree from KEDGE and to successfully finalize your exchange, students need to fulfil some additional requirements. During your studies at KEDGE, you will also have to write a Be-U report and you will have to do a Pro-Act. The Be-U report is a report about yourself, your skills and your competencies. You will be able to write this report based on the workshops KEDGE will provide to you. Lastly, the Pro-Act is a project that will have to last at least 4 months. The project can be anything, a sport or charity event, a blog (just like this one), or any other idea you might have. Once you have an idea, you can propose your idea and you can set up a team. After your idea has been accepted, you can start working on your project. For the Pro-Act you will also receive an information session during your third semester at KEDGE. 

## The process
Besides these requirements, there are some procedures you need to follow. Here I will discuss how to record your exchange, what to do if you want to receive an Erasmus+ grant and what to do with your learning agreement.

Firstly, once you prepare yourself for your departure, you will have to record your exchange in KU Locket. Your exchange coordinator will tell you how to this exactly step by step. In KU LOCKET, if you click on Exchange, you will have to fill in your information, the university you go to and the period for which you go. At first, you will have to record your first semester only. This is because for this semester you will receive an Eramus+ grant. After that, you will be able to record the entire period that is left from your exchange. 

For the Erasmus+ grant, two things need to be done. Firstly, you will receive an invitation for an English assessment in your mailbox. You will have to do this assessment before and after your first semester at KEDGE to receive your Erasmus+ grant. After you have done the English assessment, you will receive some documents to fill in. Probably, you will receive these documents while you are in France. Once you have successfully sent uploaded these documents on KU Locket, after a few weeks you will receive a part of your grant. The other part of the grant you will receive after completing your first semester at Kedge and after doing the second English assessment.

Lastly, during your first semester, you will also receive a learning agreement in your mailbox from the exchange coordinator of your home university. You will have to make sure the information of this document is correct and then you will have to give it to the exchange coordinator at KEDGE to sign it for you. This process can take a few days. Further on, after it has been signed you have to send it back to the exchange coordinator of your home university and you will also have to upload it in KU Locket.

## Other information
Lastly for this post, it is worth mentioning that in France, as a citizen of the European Union and as an international student, you are not required to ask for a residence permit. This is the case for Belgium, but not for France. Therefore, you also do not need to domiciliate in your accommodation.

So, this was it. I know that the amount of information can be overwhelming, but if you have any questions, you can always send us an e-mail or contact us on our social media. This being said, then thank you for reading and please leave a comment below if you found this information helpful.

_A bientôt!_
