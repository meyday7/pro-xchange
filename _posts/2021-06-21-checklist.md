Welcome once again! Daiana and I had decided that while this blog serves you with lots of information, you might be interest in something smaller and more compact too. That is why below you can find the checklist for your exchange in Belgium _or_ France. If you need to print it out or just keep it on your computer, you can also check the link to google drive, where you will find the pdf file.
