Introduction:

Welcome, everyone! This week's post will be the last on in this form on this blog. It will discuss the *culture of Marseille*. As usual, I will provide some information so that you can learn more about this place.

Below you can find a table of contents for this post:

- Diversity
- Food
- Marseille soap
- Tarot
- Petanque

# Diversity
Marseille is a melting pot of cultures. This is where people from all socio-economic classes and of different origins co-exist. Especially, the international nature of the city comes from its geographical position, where the Mediterranean sea makes travelling from Northern Africa, Middle East and balkans relatively easy. It is also a desired destination for people who would like to live in a vicinity of cote d'azur. While the crime in Marseille is relatively higher than that of other European cities and even capitals (Marseille in terms of area is bigger than many of the capitals in Europe), this mixture of people with differences living together is still working. Some urban geographers have attributed it to the mountainous suburbs, meaning that much social life can't develop there.

This culture diversity is also what makes this city a unique part of France. Here, the diversity is celebrated and Marseillaise (this is how one can refer to people of Marseille) take pride in being so open for other influences. That is also why Marseille in 2013 was considered a _European Capital of Culture_, together with another city in Slovakia. This culture can also be experienced in the Mucem museum, already mentioned in [our other article](https://pro-xchange.me/france/2021/06/06/france-tourism.html) on this blog.

# Food
While I am not a huge fan of Seafood, Marseille offers some great treats for those who fancy it. The most famous dish of Marseille is _Bouillabaisse_. This is a fish stew, which you can find in many restaurants around Vieux Port. From sweets, Marseille is also famous around France for its _Navette de Marseille_. Those are boat-shaped cookies. Lastly, one can try the original alcohol of Marseille called _Pastis_. It might be we have drunk it wrongly, but this is something I would not drink again. Nevertheless, you need to know of its existence!

# Marseille soap
Marseille is also famous for its internationally distributed soap. It is regionally called _Savon de Marseille_ and was already made in XIV century. This soap is made using vegetable oils, however, during the reign of Louis XIV it could have been only made using olive oil. Currently, all types of vegetable oils are allowed in the process of making Savon de Marseille. For people who would like to get a deeper understanding of the process of making soap, as well as possibly buy some original hand-made soap, you can consider visiting some of the soap makers in Marseille.

# Tarot
Some people might have heard of Tarot de Marseille, which is the most commonly used deck for Tarot nowadays. It was created by a French card-maker Paul Marteau.

# Petanque
_Petanque_ is a popular sport among people of Marseille, as well as generally in the south of France. The goal is to collect as many points as possible as a team of two. The game uses metal balls, which are used to reach the small ball used as a target. It is played on the slightly harder terrain with some sand on it. Points are scored once all players use up their balls in a specific order (based if the player throwing the ball got closer than the opponents). For more info about, check out the video below:
