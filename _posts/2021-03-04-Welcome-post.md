## Welcome to our blog!

We are truly glad to have you here!

This blog was created with the idea of providing relevant and useful information for students of KEDGE Business School or KU Leuven who plan an exchange to Marseille or Belgium.

We will be posting **every other week** (starting from 24th of March). So be sure to check what’s new! We will be posting information on different topics like housing, culture, tourism, administration and student life.

For more information about us, feel free to check the top right corner and the “About Us” section. There you can also find the information categorized based on the country you are planning to go on exchange.
