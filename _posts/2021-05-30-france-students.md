Welcome back, everyone! This week is probably the week most of you have been waiting for. So, if you asked yourself what the best places in Marseille are where you can eat, drink and party, I got you covered! In this post, you will find my favourite spots, but also, I will give you some information about how your study environment might look at KEDGE.

Also, it is worth mentioning that due to the pandemic we were not able to visit many places. Therefore, we also added some well-reviewed places in Marseille that are affordable for students.

So, without any further bla bla bla and la la la, LET’S GET STARTED!

## Food

### Steak N shake

Steak N shake has been one of the first places Karol and I went to when we arrived in France. The best things they offer are burgers (also vegetarian) and shakes of flavours you never had before such as lion, speculoos and much more. Also, the fries they offer are delicious and you can choose to eat them with cheddar and bacon or other additions. The prices are average, but it is definitely worth the price.

You can have a look at the menu on their official website [here](https://steaknshake.fr/menus/).

### 3 Brasseurs

This is without any doubt the best restaurant I have ever eaten in my entire life. The restaurant is in Valentine, so it is not so close to the city centre. However, the food is worth the long-distance, and you can easily get there by public transportation. The place offers a variety of incredible fresh foods like salads, burgers, pizzas, desserts and everything else you can think of. Also, this place is brewing its own beer and you can even buy some for home if you feel like it. I am encouraging you to go here at least once if you are in Marseille. It is a bit pricey for a student, but you might get one of the best meals you ever had, so I say it’s worth it.

### La bougnette

This place is a local pizzeria located in the 5th arrondissement. The place itself is super small and all you can find there are maybe two tables and the stone oven in which the pizzas are made. The owner is a young guy who is passionate about what he does. And you can find that passion in his pizzas because they are unbelievably good. Even though the place is small you can eat there, or you can call them personally and order your pizza at home. If you are not unsure about your French, you can also order through Uber eats, however, then you will get a smaller pizza for the same price. Also, it is more worth it to call them as if you order three pizzas then you can get a free bottle of your preferred drink. Lastly, the prices are quite cheap as the pizza you get is quite huge. Also, if you want a big pizza, please mention it, otherwise, you might get a small one.

### Noailles market

Marseille is placed in a region that is more expensive compared to the rest of France or compared to Belgium. You will see these differences in the supermarkets once you do your grocery shopping. Therefore, I introduce you to the Noailles market. Here you can find fresh fruits and vegetables for a smaller price than in the supermarkets. Around this area you can also find different local shops where you might find things you can’t in the usual supermarkets. Also, around Noailles, there are pizzerias that offer three pizzas for 10 euro. If you are broke, then it is a good deal for students.

The market is there every day between the hours mentioned [here](https://www.marseille-tourisme.com/offres/marche-de-noailles-marseille-1er-fr-2781347/).

## Bars and night life

### Shamrock

This bar is very well known to students from KEDGE and young people in general. If you want to have a sure place at a table then come early, sometimes you can even wait hours in line before you can sit down. The pub is located near the Vieux Port so you will have an amazing view while having a drink.

### Other pubs and clubs

As said before, because of the pandemic we could not visit many places. Therefore, TripAdvisor is offering a list of different bars and club you can go to in Marseille depending on your location or preferences. We also advise you to find your own local places around Marseille. The local bars and pubs are the ones the French enjoy the most, so if you want to have an experience, then take your friends and organize your own pub crawl.

The list for bars can be found [here](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g187253-Activities-c20-t99-Marseille_Bouches_du_Rhone_Provence_Alpes_Cote_d_Azur.html).

## Study life at KEDGE

Lastly, I find it important that when you arrive at KEDGE you have an idea of how things work in comparison with KU Leuven. I also need to mention that this information is valid at the moment of writing this post and that things can change by the time you go on exchange. Also, some things mentioned below were only relevant during the pandemic.

### Workload and exams

First of all, you might have seen that at KEDGE you have 5 ECTS credit courses. And at first, you might get afraid of the amount of work you will have, however this not the case. In my opinion, at KEDGE, the workload for each course is lower compared to a 3 ECTS course at KU Leuven. You will also see that the quantity to be studied for the exam is lower. 
Besides, at KEDGE each course is divided into 9 sessions. Session 1 to 8 are regular classes while session 9 is the exam itself. This means that in some weeks you might have certain courses and in others not. This results in more free time in particular weeks.

While at KU Leuven you need to start studying for your exam away before, at KEDGE it is impossible not to have a passing grade after one day of study. This is also because you will have much more group work. While at KU Leuven most of the exams count for 100%, at KEDGE most of them count for 60% or even 50%. This means that you will have to work more during the semester so the load will eventually be smaller for the exam.  Also, during the pandemic we were allowed to do the exams online, which made the exams even easier.  

Lastly, I advise you to choose your teammates for groupwork wisely. From my own experience, students from KU Leuven are very organized and knowledgeable due to the high academic level of the university. Therefore, sometimes you might be able to see that you are capable of understanding more concepts than other students. This means that, with the unwise choice of group members, a lot of work might fall on you.

### Ambient

Another thing worth mentioning is a different atmosphere. This is because of several reasons. 

The first reason is the campus itself. In comparison with the campus in Brussels, KEDGE’s campus is located in the National Park. This gives you a warm feeling and beautiful views. Besides, the campus is spacious and is equipped with everything you need. You will also see that the classrooms are also smaller as there are around 30 students in one class.

Another reason is the distance between professors and students. As you know, at KU Leuven, professors are very distant from students. This is not the case at KEDGE. Due to the smaller number of students in a classroom, as a student, you can form a closer bond with your professors. This helps you understand the concepts better, you can ask questions easily and you can even have a chat with your professors. This is one of the things I appreciate here at KEDGE.
