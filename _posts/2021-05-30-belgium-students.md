Given that you followed each stage of preparation for your exchange up until now, you are ready to study at KU Leuven! That is great, but for this experience to be truly memorable, it takes more. One of the things that will enhance your experience is how student's spend their time in Brussels! So today's post is dedicated to **student's life in Belgium**.

I will provide a list of cool bars, pubs and restaurants, where students can chill, grab some food and party! Firstly, we will start with...

## Food

I start with food because I am a serious glutton... Nevertheless, Brussels is a city, where different cuisines clash! There is plenty of choice in terms of cuisine, prices and location! Below you can find different restaurants and places to grab some delicious food!

_Disclaimer: it's subjective list, but I can vouch for most of these places. Whenever I go to Brussels, I would try to grab food in one of these!_

### The Noodle Bar

This one holds a special place in my heart! When I arrived to Brussels, it was a first place, where my parents and I went to grab some food. The restaurant serves dishes from **Asian, Thai and Chinese** cuisine. Prices are relatively cheap, but most importantly, the food is delicious! I've managed to bring couple of my friends from Poland here and everyone was amazed by the quality of food there. They also offer student **discounts**, so you can't just skip on such opportunity!

Make sure to check out their [Tripadvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g188644-d12452228-Reviews-The_Noodle_Bar_Brussels-Brussels.html) website for more details and some photos of these delicious dishes <3


### Bro's Burger Kitchen

If asian cuisine is not in your taste, then you might want to consider this gem! It's less of a restaurant, but the food is really _damn good_! Burgers and milkshakes always make for a good combo, and Bro's Burger serves delicious burgers. The shakes are also extraordinary with offering of many different flavours, including famous Belgian **Speculoos** flavour. The prices are slightly higher in comparison with typical fast-food burgers, but believe me when I say its worth the money.

As before, for more info check out the [link](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g188644-d16787669-Reviews-Bro_s_Burger_Kitchen-Brussels.html?m=19905)!

### Mr. Falafel

However, if you do not feel like grabing burgers, check Mr. Falafel next-door. Vegetarian-friendly, Mr. Falafel is considered by the people of Brussels the best place to grab falafel and I can see why! The place is incospicuous, but don't get discouraged! The man working there (and most probably the owner) is a kind, sympathetic and fun guy in the first place. You order your falafel, which you receive on a delicious bread. On the side, you have salad buffet where you can take as much as you can fit into the plastic bowl. There is plenty of salads and veggies to choose from, and for falafel you can take two or three different sauces. Falafel itself is really tasty, but in combination with all the sides and the relaxed ambient, I would absolutely suggest to visit this place at least once!

### Manhattn's Burgers

Another American style restaurant! The choice of burgers is lovely. The seasonal burgers are truly amazing and during my stay in Brussels I had opportunity to try few of them; they never disapoint! Prices are also slightly higher as well, but the choice is good! I can definitely recommend them!

There are many Manhattn's around Belgium, including few in Brussels, so just google for the one nearby you!

### Food nearby school

There are also two places right next to campus Brussels, where you can grab some food (excluding cafeteria and restaurant in school, which aren't that bad either)!

![]({{site.baseurl}}//assets/images/cuppasta.jpg)

The first one is **Cup Pasta**. Inexpensive, quick pasta to grab when you have a lunch break or you stay at school after classes. You get to choose the type of pasta (carbonara, bolognese etc.), the shape of the pasta (fussili, penne), spiciness and the size. During exam periods, if staying at school, this place can become your friend, so make sure to give it a try!

Lastly, **Scott's bar** is a go-to-place for quick food and drinks. They have pizzas (which are HUGE), nachos, other finger-foods, as well as variety of different beers, drinks and stronger alcohol. The food is pretty good and ambient is nice and relaxing. For those, who like challenges, you can try soloing their whole huge pizza for free! If you fail though, you gotta pay for it!

## Bars and night clubs

Your belly is full, so what can you do now...? Get drunk! Okay, maybe not drunk (that's irresponsible, righht?), but you can grab a drink or two. In Brussels, there are plenty of places to check when it comes to partying and drinking. Belgium, in the end, is famous for its beer! You will find many pubs advertising their variety of beers, so its not hard to find them. However, I will list few known and popular ones among KU Leuven students.

### Nua Party Bar

A pick for fans of karaoke! This club has two floors, one with public karaoke and a bar, and upstairs, where the dancefloor is. If you like **latino** or **popular** music, this it the place to party. Drinks aren't too expensive too! Just make sure when you leave this club to watch out for pickpocketers, because that area of the city center is known for muggers (speaking from experience :<).

You can find the place [here!](https://goo.gl/maps/DUDNoJxM9P2Dii166) (On google maps the place is placed badly, so check the tag in the link above)

### Madame Moustache and area

![]({{site.baseurl}}//assets/images/Madame.jpg)

While I did not have a chance to spend much time in Madame Moustache, it is a popular place among KUL students. If you do not like the vibe there or its too crowded, you can also check out the bars, clubs and restaurants around Saint Catherine. It's known area for partying, so there should be plenty of places, depending on what you feel like doing!

### Delirium CafÃ©

![]({{site.baseurl}}//assets/images/delirium.jpg)

This is one of the most famous bars in Brussels, so you might have heard about it if you were already in Brussels. In the end, they hold a Guiness World Record for the most beers offerred, being 2004 different types of beer. There is a small stage on the basement level, where occassionaly there is live music. It gets crowded downstairs, so if you need a bit more space, you can stay on the higher floor. If you have never tried it, I recommend the **Kriek** beer (cherry). It's very famous Belgian type of beer you can get in that bar too! It can get crowded as well, but in the end, what can you expect of a most known bar in Brussels!

Look for it right [here!](https://g.page/deliriumvillage?share)

### Fuse

![]({{site.baseurl}}//assets/images/fuse.jpg)

And the last place you might wanna visit is Fuse! This is a club known for its **techno** sets, so if you like that, this is your place to check. I can't tell much more about myself though... (yeah, latino is more of my thing :P)

You can find the club right [here!](https://g.page/fusebrussels?share)

## Closing words

I have discussed some of the places I recommend checking out to grab some food or to party. While there are more places worth recommending, those were the most important ones (at least in my opinion). But while you will be on your exchange, you might find some other places that are worth it!

Also, in the upcoming posts I will write more about tourism and culture in Belgium, so to find out more about them make sure you follow our social media's. Whenever new blog posts will appear, that's where you will find the link and info about it! With any other questions, make sure you leave comments below or send us an email, Daiana and I are more than happy to discuss some other questions you might have :)

Thank you a bunch for reading this post and I hope you have a good day!
