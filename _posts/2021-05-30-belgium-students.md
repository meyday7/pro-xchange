Given that you followed each stage of preparation for your exchange, you are ready to study at KU Leuven! That is great, but for this experience to be truly memorable, it takes more. One of the things that will enhance your experience is how student's spend their time in Brussels! So today's post is dedicated to **student's life in Belgium**.

I will provide a list of cool bars, pubs and restaurants, where students can chill, grab some food and party! Firstly, we will start with...

## Food

I start with food because I am a serious glutton... Nevertheless, Brussels is a city, where different cuisines clash! There is plenty of choice in terms of cuisine, prices and location! Below you can find different restaurants and places to grab some delicious food!

_Disclaimer: it's subjective list, but I can vouch for most of these places. Whenever I go to Brussels, I would try to grab food in one of these places!_

### The Noodle Bar

This one holds a special place in my heart! When I arrived to Brussels, it was a first place, where me and my parents went to grab some food. The restaurant serves dishes from **Asian, Thai and Chinese** cuisine. Prices are relatively cheap, but most importantly, the food is delicious! I've managed to bring couple of my friends from Poland here and everyone was amazed by the quality of food there. They also offer student **discounts**, so you can't just skip on such opportunity!

Make sure to check out their [Tripadvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g188644-d12452228-Reviews-The_Noodle_Bar_Brussels-Brussels.html) website for more details and some photos of these delicious dishes <3


### Bro's Burger Kitchen

If asian cuisine is not in your taste, then you might want to consider this gem! It's less of a restaurant, american style, but the food is really _damn good_! Burgers and milkshakes always make for a good combo, and Bro's Burger serves delicious burgers. The shakes are also extraordinary with offering of many different flavours, including famous Belgian **Speculoos** flavour. The prices are slightly higher in comparison with typical fast-food burgers, but believe me when I say its worth the money.

### Mr. Falafel

However, if you do not feel like grabing burgers, check Mr. Falafel next-door. Vegetarian-friendly, Mr. Falafel is considered by people in Brussels the best place to grab falafel and I can see why! The place is incospicuous, but don't get discouraged! The man working there (and most probably the owner) is a kind, sympathetic and fun guy in the first place. You order your falafel, which you receive later on a delicious bread. On the side, you have salad buffet where you take as much as you can fit into the plastic bowl. There is plenty of salads and veggies to choose from, and for falafel you can take two or three different sauces. Falafel itself is really tasty, but in combination with all the sides and the relaxed ambient, I would absolutely suggest to visit this place, at least once!

### Manhattn's Burgers

Another American style restaurant! The choice of burgers is lovely. The seasonal burgers are truly amazing and during my stay in Brussels I had opportunity to try few of them; they never disapoint! Prices are also slightly higher as well, but the choice is good! I can definitely recommend them!

There are many Manhattn's around Belgium, including few in Brussels, so just google for the one nearby you!

### Food nearby school

There are also two places right next to campus Brussels, where you can grab some food (excluding cafeteria and restaurant in school, which aren't that bad either)!

The first one is **Cup Pasta**. Inexpensive, quick pasta to grab when you have a lunch break or you stay at school longer. You get to choose the type of pasta (carbonara, bolognese etc.), the shape of the pasta (fussili, penne), spiciness and the size. During exam periods, if staying at school, this place can become your friend, so make sure to give it a try!

Lastly, **Scott's bar** is a go-to-place for quick food and drinks. They have pizzas (which are HUGE), nachos, other finger-foods, as well as variety of different beers, drinks and stronger alcohol. The food is pretty good and ambient is nice and relaxing. For those, who like challenges, you can try soloing the whole huge pizza for free! If you fail though, you gotta pay!
