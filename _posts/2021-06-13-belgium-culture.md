Welcome, everyone! This week's post, and the last one coming from me, will be all about the **culture** of Belgium. It is very rich so make sure to check the whole post; it will include some important info as well as funny or interesting parts of the history or culture of this unique country.

In this post I will discuss:
- History
- Cuisine
- Arts (comics and painting)

## History

Without getting in too many details, Belgium is a country in which two big cultures clash: German and Latin. This can be accredited to the geographical location of the country. It is right in between two main empires, being France and Germany, which created and developed two entirely different cultures. This clash, within the last 200, brought lots of disputes, disagreements and still remains a relatively controversial topic.

It is so controversial that speaking from the administrative and political point of view, Belgium is very divided. It consists of regions and communities, which encompass slightly different areas. Moreover, the regions and communities are made to distinguish the territorial influence of the cultures on different aspects of Belgians lives. For example, Belgium is divided into three regions: the Flemish region (in the north), the Walloon region (in the south) and the Brussels-Capital Region (towards the centre). The regions are related almost directly to administrative affairs like becoming a citizen, registering a new car and so on. Whenever you deal with the officials in each region, they will use different official languages (Flanders - Flemish, Walloon - French, Brussels - both). _Fun fact no. 1_: each of the regions has its own government, while there already is one federal government (managing the whole country as one). You can imagine how confusing it can get!

However, that's not everything. Belgium is also divided into _communities_! Now, communities reflect cultural and political differences. But this is still not a full picture, we also have to mention four _language areas_: Dutch, French, German and Bilingual Brussels-Capital language areas. This is the division of the official languages used in each of the areas. Those divisions come as the result of the impossibility of the people of different cultural backgrounds to co-exist and communicate. It does sound kind of silly! Those differences impacted all aspects of the lives of Belgians and resulted in many unique situations. For example, at one point in the history of KU Leuven, the Francophone students were basically kicked out of university. That is why we have Université Catholique de Louvain, which is a French equivalent of KU Leuven (currently they are not affiliated with each other). Furthermore, those differences appear even in business and finances. Companies in Brussels must choose in which language they want to report. Educational institutions technically have to choose the language in which they officially function. That is why most of the time you will hear KU Leuven teachers speak Flemish, as it is, in the end, Flemish university.

The last point on the political affairs of Belgium is whether Belgium should be divided into two countries. It seems to be a logical step given how divided the country already is. However, Belgians are not unanimous in this regard with Flanders being for it, while Walloon is against it.

NB: Belgium technically is a monarchy with Philippe being the king of the Belgians. He fulfils mostly representative role, while democratic institutions are fulfilling judicial, law-making and executive roles.

## Cuisine

We started on a bit serious side, so to compensate for that, we will talk about the _delicious_ side! If there is anything that all Belgians can agree with, it is that they have amazing food. I am talking about some of the best chocolates in the world! _Fun fact no.2_: It was a Belgian chocolatier, who created the first pralines! Moreover, the development of pralines also mostly took place in Belgium. Yummy! The choice of delicious chocolates in Belgium is overwhelming, with many different brands like Leonidas, Neuhaus, Côte d’Or and so on. Furthermore, Belgian's chocolate legacy is still expanding. You might have already seen the _ruby_ chocolate available in the shops (even on ice cream). Do you know, who created the ruby chocolate? You guessed it: Belgians!

However, if you do not have a sweet tooth or cannot eat chocolate, you might want to consider other goods Belgium has to offer. Next on the list are Belgian fries! Now, if you haven't tried these, you should try them at the nearest opportunity. These are basically upgraded french fries, everything about them is better. The texture is unparalleled, the taste is amazing, even the sauces that go with them are better than standard ketchup and mayo. It all impacts the awesomeness of the Belgian fry. The reason why they taste good comes from the process of making a Belgian fry. It is cut thicker and under-fried (in a moment you will find out why). After that, you freeze them so that they become frozen all the way inside. Once you did that, you put them to fry _again_! Amazing, who would have thought of that! The result is crispy on the outside, nice and meaty on the inside fry. Moreover, all the places offering these fries will have a crazy choice of sauces, with three of them being most popular in Belgium. Those are Andalouse, Samourai and Bernaise sauces. They are all different, with Andalouse being slightly spicy, Samourai being really spicy and Bernaise being a mild sauce.

Once you are done eating your fries, it might be a good idea to wash them down with something. But is there a better option than to do it with Belgian beer? I don't think so! The choice and variety of Belgian beers is amazing. Everyone can find something they will fancy, even people, who do not drink beer normally. For these people, the choice is simple: Kriek beer (or other fruity ones, but kriek _rules_). It's basically a cherry beer, but if I said that it tastes really good, that would be an understatement. To discover the world of Belgian beers, many pubs offer a tasting menu with different types of beer. This way you can also discover what you fancy. However, make sure you do not get drunk with those, as some beers can reach up to 12% of alcohol in their content.

The last sweet treats of Belgium discussed in this post are _waffles_. This is pretty straightforward. There are two types of waffles: Liege and Brussels ones. Liege ones are round and include caramelised sugar on them, while Brussels ones are the standard rectangle ones. Personally, I like the liege without any toppings the most, simple yet so rich and sweet <3

## Arts

Before, I have discussed the difficulties and nuances arising from the difference of cultures and the strong division between the people of Belgium. However, this also means that Belgium is very rich artistically. Two different sources of inspirations coming from different cultures mean that there is a lot to discover.

I just could not skip on Belgian _comics_ in this post. The international masterpieces like Smurfs and Tin Tin were all made in Belgium. However, there is even more to that. If you want to experience this part of Belgium, the Belgian Comic Strip Center is the right place to learn more about this piece of the history of Belgium. The museum is really interesting and interactive and provides a comprehensive overview of this craft, even for people who do not have much knowledge of comics.

The other thing is, if I was asked to mention one famous painter of Belgium, I would say Rembrandt. In the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, one can dive into the paintings of this legendary artist and learn about his inspiration and the creative process. [On this website](https://www.fine-arts-museum.be/en/visit/covid-19-measures), you can find some practical information about access to these museums.
